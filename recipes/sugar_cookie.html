    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sugar cookies that are both crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.<br>
            These cookies can also yield snickerdoodle cookies by rolling the dough in<br> 
            cinnamon-sugar prior to baking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 and 1/4 cups margarine</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar for decoration</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then the vanilla. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients until just blended.</li>
            <li>Wrap dough with plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll the balls in remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets and flatten slightly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned at the edges. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
