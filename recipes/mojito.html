    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full.<br>
            It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to<br>
            drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time! Tonic water can be substituted instead of<br>
            the soda water but the taste is different and somewhat bitter. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup ice cubes</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 fluid ounces white rum</li>
            <li>1/2 cup club soda</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler to crush the mint and lime to release the mint oils and lime juice.</li>
            <li>Add 2 more lime wedges and the sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
            <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour the rum over the ice, and fill the glass with carbonated water.</li>
            <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
            <li>Garnish with the remaining lime wedge.</li>
        </ol>
